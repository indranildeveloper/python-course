String Escape Characters

Escape Character
To insert characters that are illegal in a string, use an escape character.

An escape character is a backslash \\ followed by the character you want to insert.

An example of an illegal character is a double quote inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:

\'	Single Quote
\"	Double Quote
\\	Backslash
\n	New Line
\r	Carriage Return
\t	Tab
\b	Backspace
\f	Form Feed
