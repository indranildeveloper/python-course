Python If Statement

Python Conditions and If statements

Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

    Equals: a == b
    Not Equals: a != b
    Less than: a < b
    Less than or equal to: a <= b
    Greater than: a > b
    Greater than or equal to: a >= b

These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.

The Elif Keyword

The elif keyword is Python's way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".

The elif keyword allows you to check multiple expressions for True and execute a block of code as soon as one of the conditions evaluates to True.

The Else Keyword

The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.

The else statement is executed when the if condition (and any elif conditions) evaluate to False.
